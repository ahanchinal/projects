# projects
This repository is to showcase various projects that I have worked on and include documents on the following:

1. **Disney+ Hotstar (Nextleap Product Management Bootcamp)** - Prepared a solution for the ‘Paradox of Choice’ (decision paralysis) problem faced by users of Disney+ Hotstar, wherein I conducted user surveys, defined personas, designed wireframes, and prioritized solutions, measuring success through key metrics and risk mitigation strategies, earning a position in Top Fellows list (top 25 out of a batch of 250+ students).
2. **Clipboard Health Case Study** - Analysed user data from Clipboard Health to identify trends and create possible product problem statements.
