# projects
This repository is to showcase various projects that I have worked on and include documents on the following:

1. **Product management** - Prepared a solution for the ‘Paradox of Choice’ (decision paralysis) problem faced by users of Disney+ Hotstar, wherein I conducted user surveys, defined personas, designed wireframes, and prioritized solutions, measuring success through key metrics and risk mitigation strategies, earning a position in Top Fellows list (top 25 out of a batch of 250+ students).
2. **Data analysis & Problem Identification** - Analysed user data from Clipboard Health to identify trends and create possible product problem statements.
3. **No-code sequence creation** - Built an automated job outreach system using low code tools on Make.com, APIs, Gmail and Google Drive to identify recruiters, send personalized emails, and attach resumes, reducing manual effort by 80% and scaling outreach to 30+ recruiters per day.
